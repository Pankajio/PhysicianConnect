                <h2>Project Overview &amp; Vision</h2>
                <p><em>PhysicianConnect</em> is a centralized platform that simplifies communication between patients,
                    physicians, and receptionists. We aim to reduce administrative friction, improve communication, and
                    make it easier to manage appointments, billing, prescriptions, referrals and patient data in one
                    place.</p>

                <p>Physicians can set their availability, review pre-visit notes, and handle post-visit tasks like
                    writing prescriptions, making referrals, and logging follow-ups all in one place. Patients can
                    easily book appointments, receive updates, and access their medical information. Receptionists gain
                    tools to coordinate visits, handle billing, and keep the clinic running smoothly.
                </p>

                <p>Fast, focused, and secure, PhysicianConnect cuts through the complexity of traditional EMRs so
                    clinics can stay organized and deliver better care with less time spent on paperwork and more time
                    focused on people.

                <ul class="team-list">
                    <li>Gagandeep Dolla<span class="skill">Throughout the project, I focused a lot on maintaining clean
                            Git workflows, managing feature branches, resolving tricky merge conflicts, and keeping our
                            history organized. I also worked on writing meaningful tests using JUnit, which helped
                            improve reliability as we added more features. Since we were working as a team, I got to
                            apply what I’ve learned from past courses and work experience about writing modular,
                            testable code and making sure my changes integrated smoothly with everyone else’s work. This
                            project really helped me sharpen those collaboration and debugging skills that matter in
                            real-world development.</span></li>
                    <li>Mohammad Islam<span class="skill">Taking the summer version of 3350 gave me a good
                            idea of how teams usually work day to day, since we were putting in hours similar to a
                            normal job. Working with tight deadlines brought out a level of productivity in me I didn’t
                            know I had. I learned most about persistence from 3350, since I didn’t take 3380. I also got
                            a much better understanding of why testing is important and how to actually do it properly,
                            something I almost completely ignored in older projects. In terms of implementing features,
                            while my mindset was initially focused more on just building things, I gradually shifted
                            toward writing code that followed solid principles. Planning features with user stories
                            helped me structure ideas better, something I will keep using as a tool for future projects.
                            I also got solid experience with Git, like handling branches, fixing merge conflicts, and
                            working in a shared repo.</span></li>
                    <li>Pankaj Jhanji<span class="skill"> I think for me it would definitely have to be learning to get
                            into a more leadership role/ QA role. Learning to go through other people’s code and leave
                            feedback as a TA but this time around I was able to have a back and forth with them which
                            was very nice, alongside that there was also the idea of finding bugs and assigning tickets,
                            having to jump into various parts of the project to help out wherever I could. All these
                            were very fun skills that I think developed further. </span></li>
                    <li>Arjun Sarkar<span class="skill">One specific development skill I gained through this project
                            would be learning how to manage and fuse feature branches effectively in a team environment.
                            Even though I was familiar with Git before, through this project it taught me how to manage
                            more complex workflows that involve working with multiple contributors, code reviews and
                            merge conflicts. I am getting better at writing cleaner commits, discussing merge conflict
                            issues with the team and structuring branches logically. Another useful experience I gained
                            working in this project is working with a variety of user types such as physicians, and
                            receptionists (and patients too but time didn’t permit us to do so). It is cool to view each
                            user’s unique views and permissions. To me, testing and building these user types assisted
                            me into thinking deeply about access control, user interface, authentication and overall
                            user experience. It made me think critically about how each feature as well as user stories
                            should behave depending on who is using it.</span></li>
                    <li>Ibrahim Mamman<span class="skill">This project gave me a much stronger understanding of how Git
                            works in a real team setting. Before this, I had only used Git in a basic way, but now I
                            feel confident using branches, resolving merge conflicts, and contributing to a shared repo.
                            I also learned a lot about teamwork—how to communicate effectively, coordinate tasks, and
                            make sure everyone's changes fit together. On top of that, I really came to appreciate the
                            software development cycle, especially Agile. I liked the rhythm of working in sprints,
                            writing user stories, and regularly checking in to adapt our plans. It made the whole
                            process feel more organized and productive.</span></li>

            <div class="container">
                <h2>Development Post‑mortem</h2>
                <p><strong>What was the overall architecture of your system (particularly if it is different from the
                        demo system)?</strong><br>
                    Our system followed a MVC (Model-View-Controller) structure, which means we kept the logic, the
                    interface, and the data in their own parts, which made it easier to update and test. It was more
                    organized than the basic demo system we saw in class.</p>

                <p><strong>What went right in the development process?</strong><br>
                    We did really well at communicating as a team and keeping each other updated through daily
                    check-ins. Our Git branches were well-named, our commits were clear, and we were careful about
                    testing before merging code into the main project.</p>

                <p><strong>What went wrong in the development process?</strong><br>
                    At first, we ran into problems with merge conflicts because we didn’t always test or review things
                    before merging, which caused bugs and delays.</p>

                <p><strong>What would you do differently, if you had the chance to start over?</strong><br>
                    If we could go back, we would plan out all the user roles, features, and implementations in more
                    detail before we started building, so technical debt would have been much less than it was.</p>

                <p><strong>How large is the project (number of methods, classes, etc)? How much of this is (roughly)
                        devoted to each major system component? And any other quantifiables (e.g. if you have a record
                        of hours spent on tasks).</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Overall Project Size</strong><br>
                    Total Classes: approximately 60 - 65 classes<br>
                    Total Methods: approximately 200 - 250 methods<br>
                    Major Components: 4 Main System Components</p>

                    Supporting objects: TimeSlot, ServiceItem, Invoice, etc.</p>

                <p><strong>Key Features Implementation</strong><br>
                    Appointment Management<br>
                    Physician/Receptionist Management<br>
                    Messaging System<br>
                    Billing and Invoicing<br>
                    Prescription Management<br>
                    Referral System<br>
                    Notification System</p>

                <p><strong>Architecture Patterns:</strong><br>
                    MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern<br>
                    Repository pattern for data access<br>
                    Factory pattern for object creation<br>
                    Observer pattern for notifications</p>

                <p><strong>Testing Coverage</strong><br>
                    Test classes present for UI components<br>
                    Mock implementations for testing<br>
                    Unit tests for core functionality</p>

                <p><strong>What took the most time? The least? Any surprises?</strong><br>
                    Appointment Slot Management and Notifications were the most time consuming features in our project.
                    Creating the notification feature was surprisingly a big hassle, and although its functionality
                    worked, we were not able to make it work across two separate instances of the application at once
                    and had to resort to creating two.</p>

                <p><strong>Are there any particular design smells, or brilliant design decisions?</strong><br>
                    One glaring design issue is that our physician and receptionist app components in the presentation
                    layer are handling too much logic, which violates the Single Responsibility Principle. To address
                    this, we plan to refactor them to better follow SOLID principles, improving maintainability and
                    separation of concerns.</p>

                <p><strong>Are there any outstanding bugs?</strong><br>
                    To test messaging and notifications, we currently open two account dialogs within a single instance
                    of the application. This setup leads to duplicate messages and alerts across the board. We haven’t
                    yet found a way to share the database across multiple instances of the app, which would better
                    reflect a real-world scenario where different users run the app independently.</p>

                <p><strong>Did any features work better than expected?</strong><br>
                    Yes, our appointment slot management views have been a valuable addition to the project and are
                    truly one of its standout features. They provide an amazing interface for managing availability,
                    scheduling appointments efficiently, and minimizing conflicts—making them central to the overall
                    functionality and user experience of our application.</p>

                <p><strong>Are you using any technologies other than what was required (e.g. JMock, GUI builders,
                        etc.)?</strong><br>
                    No, we adhered to the required technologies and did not use any additional tools or frameworks
                    beyond what was specified.</p>

                <p><strong>Are you using any specific techniques covered in the course (TDD, pair programming, scrums,
                        etc)?</strong><br>
                    We used test-driven development (TDD) for key parts of the logic, pair programming for trickier
                    sections, and Scrum ideas like sprints and weekly check-ins to stay organized.</p>

                <p><strong>How did the project change from your initial (iteration 0) vision or stories, or did it work
                        out as predicted?</strong><br>
                    Initially, we planned to design our app for both physicians and patients. However, upon feedback, we
                    realized it didn't make sense for patients to use such a system directly. Hence we shifted our focus
                    to creating an app for physicians and receptionists. This led to the development of features like
                    billing and an overall appointment view of all physicians, and we modified some existing
                    patient-related functionalities to better suit the receptionist's role.</p>

                <p><strong>What did you learn about team or large project development? What will you start doing, keep
                        doing, or stop doing next time?</strong><br>
                    We learned that it’s super important to break down tasks, keep communication strong, and avoid big,
                    risky changes late in the process.</p>

                <p><strong>Can you draw any conclusions from what you’ve done?</strong><br>
                    In the end, we learned that with solid teamwork, good planning, and patience through challenges like
                    bugs and merge issues, it’s possible to build something useful and reliable as a group.</p>
